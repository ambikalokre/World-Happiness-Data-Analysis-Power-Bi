# World Happiness Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Created using Power BI)
## Project Objective:
To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that effectively visualizes global happiness trends from 2015 to 2019. The dashboard will leverage six key charts to:
1.	Identify the most and least happy countries,
2.	Analyze the correlation between happiness and factors like GDP, freedom, and life expectancy,
3.	And provide a dynamic overview of global happiness levels through a speedometer metric. This dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for understanding the factors contributing to global happiness and identifying areas for improvement.
